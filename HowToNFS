//HOWTO: NFS Server/Client


//Install NFS Server Support
//at the terminal type
sudo apt-get install sysvinit-utils nfs-kernel-server nfs-common portmap
//When configuring portmap do =not= bind loopback. If you do you can either edit /etc/default/portmap by hand or run:
sudo dpkg-reconfigure portmap
sudo service portmap restart
//This is where we put the Linux FileSystem
sudo mkdir /ps3root
//Editing /etc/exports
//the /etc/exports file is used for creating a share on the NFS server

//invoke your favorite text editor under root 

gksudo gedit /etc/exports 
//or
sudo vi /etc/exports

//Here is example of what you should add to your /etc/exports

//For Full Read Write Permissions allowing any computer from 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.255
 /ps3root 192.168.0/255.0/255(rw,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash,async)


//Also aftter making changes to /etc/exports in a terminal you must type
sudo exportfs -a
sudo service nfs-kernel-server restart
// This is what is set in defualt kernal for the loader
sudo ifconfig YOURDEVICE 192.168.2.7


//Install NFS client support
sudo apt-get install portmap nfs-common

//Mounting manually and Test
//Example to mount server.mydomain.com:/files to /files. In this example server.mydomain.com is the name of the server containing the nfs share, and //files is the name of the share on the nfs server

//The mount point /files must first exist on the client machine. 
cd /
sudo mkdir files

//to mount the share from a terminal type
//Your IP and mount dir is based on what your dtbImage.ps3.bin says it is(defualt IP is 192.168.2.100 and mount is /ps3root.
//dtbImage.ps3.bin can be in two places /dev_usb0/ or /dev_hdd0/game/LOAD00000/USRDIR. usb is your custom
//OPen with a Hex editor search for the text "HEX" just above is where you need to edit. make sure it keeps its lentgh!!
//Also you can edit your mount here
sudo mount 192.168.2.7:/ps3root /files

//Note you may need to restart above services:
sudo /etc/init.d/portmap restart
sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-common restart
