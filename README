                               AsbestOS Hybrid Loader README
================================================================================

== Introduction Requirements==
This a AsbestOS Linux bootloader that runs off of the PS3 Lv-2 exploit. 
It is designed to boot on PS3 systems running System Software version 3.41, 
though it could be adapted to earlier versions. Linux runs on the GameOS partition, 
thus having the same access to hardware that GameOS has.
This code is experimental and is intended for those who have a 16KB USB dongle 
and no possibility to launch asbestOS in other form.
It also requires you to be using Hermes' 4vB payload.
to compile is best to be using linux, as i have not tested on windows 

== Building ==

The PS3DEV environment variable needs Setup

$  mkdir ~/ps3dev               // I Find in my user drive i have no permison problems
$  mkdir ~/ps3dev
Add these to the end of you ~/.bashrc file

  export PS3DEV=~/ps3dev
  export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/bin
  export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/ppu/bin
  export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/spu/bin
  export PSL1GHT=~/pslight

$ git clone git://github.com/HACKERCHANNEL/ps3chain.git ~/ps3chain

$ git clone git://github.com/HACKERCHANNEL/PSL1GHT.git  ~/PSl1GHT

Then Read the readme under both those drives and compile how they lay out.
rember we have already set the PS3DEV and PSL1GHT vars


== Usage ==

First compile AsbestOS Loader get a compatible USB exploit mechanism. 
You should also connect your PS3 and PC to a network not the internet.
(they need to be in the same broadcast domain also) 

P3
	Do nothing but plug into your router
PC
	there is where everyone seems to have the trubble.
	i have created a easy setup guide for the NFS share.
	Read HowToNFS.
	if you cant do this becuase your in windows run Virtualbox
	with your fav linux. bridge the network cards under VM setup.
	and then continue with the Guide.


Transfer the AsbestOSHybridLoader.pkg (that you compiled )
to the root of a thumb drive
At this point if you have edit you own dtbImage.ps3.bin
(marcan's kernel image included under xdata) 
Copy them to the root of you usb thumb drive.


Fire off the exploit device, turn on your PS3 using power followed by eject within 0.2 seconds . 

Install the pkg AsbestOSHybribLoader.pkg. 
OK now find the penguin and run the Program.
\
Ok the scary part the screen goes black.it....Wait for it....If you get anything at all, congratulations, Kernel is running.
At this point, if you have any issues, the problem should be fairly apparent from the messages (Kernel panic NFS not mounted).
If not then there could be a cupple things wrong. There has been reports that there is a issuse with SD tvs. 
I can not comfirm because i do not own a tv.I happen to run mine to a Monitor with a HDMI > DVI cable.
There are also been reports of it not working on Phat PS3s. as im not sure about this (one friend told me it worked on his phat),


Once the PS3 is up and running and your NFS share.you should now have a Working AsbestOS.

== ToDo ==
spell check every thing (ROFL i cant spell sorry)
